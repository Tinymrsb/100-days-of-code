# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 14, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Forked first GitHub Repo, Created Hashnode blog, worked on Tribute Page on CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy I have finally gotten a chance to USE GitHub while learning. Right now it is still an intimidating place but I have hopes that I will become comfortable with the interface soon. As for today's coding, I progressed on my Tribute page and plan to complete it tomorrow for Day 2.

### Day 2: February 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today was a bit scattered but I was able to complete my tribue page first thing this morning. That felt great! Now I'm on to my second project.

**Thoughts**: Completing a project was a great feeling!

### Day 3: February 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed my second project start to finish. I created a simple form on CodePen for FreeCodeCamp.

### Day 5: February 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Slow and steady today. I rushed through my first two projects. For this project, a Product Landing Page, I'm going to take time to make it feel more appealing. Using an iOS app I created mockups of the landing page I would like to create.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to slow down, I'm learning but I also want to enjoy the creation and design.

### Day 6: February 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: My current project is the FCC landing page. Using my mockup from Day 5 I started laying out the code on CodePen and completely hit a brick wall. I realized I'm not grasping flexbox, which is what I planned to use. So I took time to write up practice flexbox layouts and found a great tutorial video to help me out with the concepts. 

**Thoughts:** Slow an steady wins the race

### Day 7: February 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today was a very slow learning day. We are selling our house, so life has taken presidence. 

**Thoughts:** I've learned that I need to schedule late night lesson time on busy days.

**Link to work**: None today

### Day 8: February 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Making time to practice flexbox today with the Froggy game. I've used it before, but when searching here on GitHub I was reminded of it.

**Thoughts:** Games that encourage repetition and practice are really great learning tools for me.

**Link to work**: Site used for practice: https://flexboxfroggy.com/

### Day 9: February 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox again was a fun skill to practice today.

**Thoughts:** Finding games based on the syntax has been so fun.

**Link to work**: Games I've been playing https://twitter.com/tinymrsb/status/1495434818317860867?s=20&t=QFZwKJIqSb2pKbSk0kunwQ

### Day 10: February 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Began writing out HTML and CSS for Landing Page project. I'm using CodePen.io

**Thoughts:** The games I've been using to practive have helped so much. I am going to create a cheatsheet for myself with the flexbox rules. When I find cheatsheets and documents they have TOO much info.

### Day 11: February 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Let JavaScript begin! I've started JS in FCC. Even tho I'm am needing to complete three projects for my Responsive Web Design Certification I feel like I need to keep moving forward. The projects will come, that is why my journey is self-taught and self-paced.

### Day 14: February 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: The world is an exhausting place, the news can be overwhelming. I'm blessed to be in the position I am. Today I took a step back and completed some HTML and CSS review on the Sololearn app on my iPad.

**Thoughts:** This review is much less hands on but does bring needed challenges to help solidify concepts.

### Day 15: February 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: While working on my FCC project I want to use my own images, even if its a landing page for fake company or product. I love using Canva so this is an opportunity to mesh canva into my work. Using the link below I followed the steps to host images here on GitHub. It took a few tutorials to find the best route but this 'hack' was a winner.

**Thoughts:** GitHub is a welth of knowledge, im just a the starting line.

## Day 37: March 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today I did not code. Today I realized I need to organize my learning in a way that helps me focus on LEARNING and not searching for things to learn.

**Thoughts:** It is easy to get sucked into a loop of 'OOOH shiny new project' and never come up for air. So today I made some changes. I automated some of my 'time waisting' tasks like social media, I made a game plan for the time of day I want to focus on learning each day.
