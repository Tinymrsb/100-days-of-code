# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 14, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Forked first GitHub Repo, Created Hashnode blog, worked on Tribute Page on CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy I have finally gotten a chance to USE GitHub while learning. Right now it is still an intimidating place but I have hopes that I will become comfortable with the interface soon. As for today's coding, I progressed on my Tribute page and plan to complete it tomorrow for Day 2.

**Today's Progress**: Today was a bit scattered but I was able to complete my tribue page first thing this morning. That felt great! Now I'm on to my second project.

**Thoughts**: Completing a project was a great feeling!

### Day 5: February 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Slow and steady today. I rushed through my first two projects. For this project, a Product Landing Page, I'm going to take time to make it feel more appealing. Using an iOS app I created mockups of the landing page I would like to create.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to slow down, I'm learning but I also want to enjoy the creation and design.

### Day 6: February 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: My current project is the FCC landing page. Using my mockup from Day 5 I started laying out the code on CodePen and completely hit a brick wall. I realized I'm not grasping flexbox, which is what I planned to use. So I took time to write up practice flexbox layouts and found a great tutorial video to help me out with the concepts. 

**Thoughts:** Slow an steady wins the race

### Day 7: February 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today was a very slow learning day. We are selling our house, so life has taken presidence. 

**Thoughts:** I've learned that I need to schedule late night lesson time on busy days.
