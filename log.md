# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 14, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Forked first GitHub Repo, Created Hashnode blog, worked on Tribute Page on CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy I have finally gotten a chance to USE GitHub while learning. Right now it is still an intimidating place but I have hopes that I will become comfortable with the interface soon. As for today's coding, I progressed on my Tribute page and plan to complete it tomorrow for Day 2.
